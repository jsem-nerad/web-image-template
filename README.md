# Web image manipulation template
This was originally just a funny project for my class and friends, but I thought I could upload it to GitHub, so there it is.

## Backstory
I came up with this when I took a picture of my friend staring at a poster, so I thought I could put there my custom image instead of the poster, so I did it in gimp. But then I thought: what if anyone could put there their custom image easily using a web app, so there it is.

## About the code:
There are 4 predefined points on the base image, that are the corners of the poster, and using JavaScript with perspective-transform library, it scales the custom picture to those 4 points.
